A CLI tool by @DASHISTRASH and @ROUTERRAGE

```
OpenPortsScanner (OPS) is a CLI tool that tests all open ports on a given IP. It is open-source and incredibly powerful, making it the go-to choice for developers and network engineers.

## Features

* üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **Open-Source**: OPS is an open-source project, meaning it is free to use and modify, and anyone can contribute to the project.
* üöÄ **Powerful**: OPS is incredibly powerful, allowing users to quickly check for open ports on a given IP address.
* üí™ **Flexible**: OPS has many options for customizing the port scan, including a range of ports to check for, a timeout for determining if a port is open or closed, and the ability to output results to a file.

## How to Use

Using OpenPortsScanner (OPS) is easy and straightforward. To get the help screen, use:

`>ops -h`

To scan an IP with all the default settings, use:

`>ops -i 1.2.3.4`

To specify a range of ports to check for, use:

`>ops -i 1.2.3.4 -r 1000-3000`

To output the working ports to a file, use:

`>ops -i 1.2.3.4 -o ./test.txt`

To specify a timeout (after how long it determines that the port isn't working in milliseconds), use:

`>ops -i 1.2.3.4 -t 5000`
